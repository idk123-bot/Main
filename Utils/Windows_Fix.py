Windows UTF-8 Encoding Fix

This module forces Windows terminals to use UTF-8 encoding instead of cp1252.
Import this ONCE at the very top of your main.py file to enable emoji support
and proper Unicode handling across your entire application.

Usage:
    import utils.windows_fix  # That's it. No function calls needed.

Why this works:
    The import statement executes all top-level code in the module exactly once.
    This sets up the UTF-8 wrapper before any other code runs.

def _apply_windows_utf8_fix():
    """
    Internal function that applies the UTF-8 encoding fix.
    The underscore prefix (_apply_windows_utf8_fix) is a Python convention
    that means "this is private, don't call it directly."
